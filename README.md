## About development
Developing Relativyze was about creating a smooth and efficient tool for linguistic exploration. I utilized Next.js to build a robust, high-performance platform with real-time updates. React's component-based architecture enabled us to design a dynamic and user-friendly interface. Tailwind CSS was key in achieving a sleek, responsive design that works flawlessly on any device. I also chose SQL for its reliable and powerful data management capabilities, crucial for handling extensive linguistic datasets. Relativyze is designed to provide a comprehensive and enjoyable user experience, making it easy to set up your API key and start exploring word similarities immediately.
